Welcome to the Car Damage Detection repository! This project focuses on utilizing a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect various types of damage on cars, such as scratches, dents, and other imperfections. The detected condition of the car is then leveraged as a feature to predict its price.

## Overview

Car damage detection is a crucial aspect of assessing the condition and value of a vehicle. By employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this repository offers a robust solution for automatically detecting and classifying different types of damages, enabling users to make informed decisions about car purchases or insurance claims.

## Features

- Custom-trained YOLOv8 model for car damage detection.
- Detection of scratches, dents, and other damage types.
- Integration of damage condition as a feature for car price prediction.
