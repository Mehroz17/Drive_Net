## Overview
Price prediction is crucial in the second-hand car market, and this repository focuses on building a model 
using machine learning algorithms tailored for automotive industries. Features such as engine capacity, 
model year, category, fuel type, mileage, car brand, and car name are utilized for prediction. A unique 
aspect is the integration of car condition, computed from a car damage detection model that analyzes images 
to categorize the car's condition as excellent, fair, good, or poor. This integrated information enhances the 
accuracy of price predictions, empowering users to make informed decisions in the second-hand car market.
